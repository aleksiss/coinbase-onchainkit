# Use Basename

Basenames are an essential onchain building block that empowers builders to establish their identity on Base by registering human-readable names for their wallet addresses.

They operate entirely onchain, utilizing the same technology as ENS names, and are deployed on Base. 

You can integrate [Basenames](https://www.base.org/names) into your app with few these steps.
