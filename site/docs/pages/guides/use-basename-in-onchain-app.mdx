# Use Basename

Basenames are an essential onchain building block that empowers builders to establish their identity on Base by registering human-readable names for their wallet addresses.

They operate entirely onchain, utilizing the same technology as ENS names, and are deployed on Base. 

You can integrate [Basenames](https://www.base.org/names) into your app with few these steps.

::::steps

### Install OnchainKit

New to OnchainKit? Follow the [Getting Started](/getting-started) guide to install the package.

Already using OnchainKit? Update to the latest version and choose from the following steps: a React component approach, a React hook, or a pure TypeScript utility function.

### React Component with `<Name>`

Use the [`<Name>`](/identity/name) component to display Basenames associated with Ethereum addresses.

The `chain` prop is optional and setting to Base it what makes the component switch from ENS to Basenames.

```tsx
import { Name } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/identity';
import { base } from 'viem/chains';

const address = '0x02feeb0AdE57b6adEEdE5A4EEea6Cf8c21BeB6B1';

// omitted component code for brevity
<Name address={address} chain={base} />
```

<App>
  <Name address="0x02feeb0AdE57b6adEEdE5A4EEea6Cf8c21BeB6B1" chain={base}/>
</App>

### React Hook with `useName`

ok

### Typescript utility with `getName`

Use the [`getName`](/identity/get-name) function to get Basenames associated with Ethereum addresses.

Because it's a pure function, you can use it in any TypeScript project, like Vue, Angular, Svelte or Node.js .

```tsx

:::code-group

```tsx [code]
import { getName } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/identity';
import { base } from 'viem/chains';

const address = '0x02feeb0AdE57b6adEEdE5A4EEea6Cf8c21BeB6B1';
const name = await getName({ address, chain: base });
```

```ts [return value]
zizzamia.base.eth;
```
