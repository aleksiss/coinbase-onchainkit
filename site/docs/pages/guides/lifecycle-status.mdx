OnchainKit is a design system that offers common components for onchain applications 
and allows you to manage the state of APIs and onchain transactions seamlessly within those components.

To give you complete control over the state of your components and the data they fetch, 
OnchainKit introduces a **Lifecycle Status**.


## What is the Lifecycle Status?

The lifecycle status is the drummer of your components, maintaining a consistent tempo and rhythm for your components and the data they fetch. 🥁

It influences how the components work together and how you, as the developer, can tap into the rhythm and customize the behavior of your components. 🎶

## How to listen to the Lifecycle status

The Lifecycle Status is a TypeScript object that provides easy access to the `statusName` and `statusData` properties, 
allowing you to stay informed and responsive.

```ts
import type { LifecycleStatus } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/transaction';

const handleOnStatus = useCallback(status: LifecycleStatus) => {
  console.log('LifecycleStatus', status);
}, []);

<Transaction onStatus={handleOnStatus}>
  // omitted component code for brevity
</Transaction>
```

## Lifecycle Status vibes 🎸

The Lifecycle Status includes 3 states common to all components:

### `init`

The component is initialized and ready for use.

```ts
{
  statusName: 'init';
  statusData: null;
}
```

### `success`

The component has successfully completed its main action, such as `swap` or `transaction`.

```ts
{
  statusName: 'success';
  statusData: {
    // the data returned from the API or onchain operation
  };
}
```

### `error`

The component has encountered an issue while fetching API data, executing an on-chain operation, or needs to display a visual message to the user.

```ts
{
  statusName: 'error';
  statusData: {
    code: string; // The error code representing the location of the error
    error: string; // The error message providing developer details
    message: string; // The error message providing user-facing details
  };
}
```

Each component brings its own unique experience, and we have explored both the swap and transaction processes.

## Lifecycle Status with [`<Swap />`](/swap/swap)

### `amountChange`

The component is waiting for the user to approve the transaction.

```ts
{
  statusName: 'amountChange';
  statusData: {
  };
}
```

### `transactionPending`

The component is waiting for the user to confirm the swap.

```ts
{
  statusName: 'transactionPending';
  statusData: {
  };
}
```

### `transactionApproved`

The component is waiting for the user to confirm the swap.

```ts
{
  statusName: 'transactionApproved';
  statusData: {
  };
}
```

### `success`

The component is waiting for the user to confirm the swap.

```ts
{
  statusName: 'success';
  statusData: {
    transactionReceipt: TransactionReceipt;
  };
}
```

## Lifecycle Status with [`<Transaction />`](/transaction/transaction)

### `transactionIdle`

The component is waiting for the user to confirm the swap.

```ts
{
  statusName: 'success';
  statusData: {
  };
}
```

### `transactionPending`

The component is waiting for the user to confirm the swap.

```ts
{
  statusName: 'success';
  statusData: {
  };
}
```

### `transactionLegacyExecuted`

The component is waiting for the user to confirm the swap.

```ts
{
  statusName: 'success';
  statusData: {
  };
}
```

### `success`

The component is waiting for the user to confirm the swap.

```ts
{
  statusName: 'success';
  statusData: {
    transactionReceipts: TransactionReceipt[];
  };
}
```

## How to contribute to the Lifecycle Status

The lifecycle status is **new** for OnchainKit, and we are continuously iterating to make it better.
