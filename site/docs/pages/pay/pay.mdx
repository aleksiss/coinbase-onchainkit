## Quick start

Before using the `Pay` component, ensure you've completed all [Getting Started steps](/getting-started).

If you're starting a new project, we recommend using [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) to scaffold your project following our [Getting Started](/getting-started) steps.

If you're adding the component to an existing project, simply install OnchainKit (`npm install @coinbase/onchainkit@latest`). Wrap the `<OnchainKitProvider />` around your app following steps in [Getting Started](/getting-started).
