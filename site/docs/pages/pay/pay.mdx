## Features
- **Plug-and-Play Integration:** Add our `Pay` button with just a few lines of code. No backend required.

## Prerequisites

Before using the `Pay` component, ensure you've completed the [Getting Started](/getting-started) steps.

If you're starting a new project, we recommend using [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) to scaffold your project following our [Getting Started](/getting-started) steps.

If you're adding the component to an existing project, simply install OnchainKit (`npm install @coinbase/onchainkit@latest`). Wrap the `<OnchainKitProvider />` around your app following steps in [Getting Started](/getting-started).

## Quickstart

::::steps

### Sign up for a Coinbase Commerce account

Head to [Coinbase Commerce](https://beta.commerce.coinbase.com/) and sign up. This is where you’ll manage transactions, view reports, and configure payments.

### Create a product and copy the `productId`

In the Coinbase Commerce dashboard, create a new product and copy the `productId`.

### Import the component

```tsx twoslash
import { Pay, PayButton, PayStatus } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/pay';

<Pay productId='my-product-id' > 
  <PayButton coinbaseBranded/> // set coinbaseBranded for branding
  <PayStatus />
</Pay>
```
::::

That's it! Starting selling onchain with just a few lines of code. 

## Usage

### Add Coinbase branding

You can add Coinbase branding to the component by using the `coinbaseBranded` prop on `PayButton`.

```tsx twoslash
import { Pay, PayButton } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/pay';

export default function PayComponents() {
  return (
// ---cut-before---
<Pay >
  <PayButton coinbaseBranded/> // [!code focus]
</Pay>
// ---cut-after---
);
}
```

<App>
  <Pay>
    <PayButton coinbaseBranded disabled/>
  </Pay>
</App>

### Override styles

You can override component styles using `className`.
```tsx twoslash

import { Pay, PayButton } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/pay';

export default function PayComponents() {
  return (
// ---cut-before---
<Pay >
  <PayButton className='bg-[#EA580C]'/> // [!code focus]
</Pay>
// ---cut-after---
);
}
```

<App>
  <Pay>
    <PayButton className='bg-[#EA580C]' disabled/>
  </Pay>
</App>


## Example use cases
- **Demand-based pricing:** Allow users to select seats or ticket types for events, and dynamically calculate charges based on availability and demand.
- **Product bundles:** Provide users with the option to create custom product bundles, applying discounts or special pricing based on the selected items.
- **Freelance Services:** Allow clients to specify project details such as hours, deliverables, and deadlines, and generate charges based on these custom inputs.

### Create the charge in your backend

We expose a prop called `chargeId` which will take a callback that returns a charge ID. This developer-provided callback **MUST** return a valid chargeId, and is run on every click to the Pay button. 

The chargeId returned from the callback is then hydrated by our backend API, which will send the batched commerce request to the Smart Wallet.
